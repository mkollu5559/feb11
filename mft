Subject: MFT Start/Stop Migration to CFS2 – QA Testing Window

Hi Team,

As you know, CFS1 GitLab will be retired in June 2026. We are planning to migrate the MFT start/stop process from CFS1 to CFS2 cloud.

We would like to begin QA testing sometime after 2/25. Please let us know if you foresee any issues, dependencies, or conflicts that could impact testing or the migration.

Also, if there is a preferred QA testing window after 2/25, please share your availability so we can coordinate accordingly.

Thank you,
Maneesha
